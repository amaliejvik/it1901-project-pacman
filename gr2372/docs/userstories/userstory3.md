## PacMan - User story 3
**Turid**
<br>
Turid is 78 years old and wants to reminisce about the times when she took her children to the arcade to play Pacman. To do this, she has asked her children to download the application on her EDB machine so that she can experience the nostalgia.

Her children feel it's necessary for the game not to be as fast-paced as the original, and it shouldn't be too complicated so that Turid can also experience a sense of achievement. The most important thing is to include all the classic elements, such as the music. Additionally, Turid doesn't have internet at home, so it's important that she can play offline when her children are not around to share their internet connection.
